# Econometrics-with-R
This repository consist of all my practise assignments I am undertaking to learn Econometrics with R. I am following the textbook titled 'Introductory Statistics' by Sheldon M Ross. Most of the code in the upcoming
notebooks/scripts will be inspired and sometimes directly taken from there. I might later follow some another source and in alll the good cases come up with the new projects of my own. Till then you can have a look.
A detailed index will be coming up soon.
